              I am a computer geek who is currently exploring the world of WEB
              and APP Technologies. I am currently in the HTML or CSS section.
              It will take around 2 months more to learn something extra in the
              field. Currently I am learning from
              <strong>Colt Stlee</strong> and <strong> Dr Angela Yu</strong>.
              Now i am planning to buy two more courses from a instructor about
              HTML or css which are bestseller on the Udemy. These are for
              deeper diving into this field. The course would cost me around INR
              1000 but they are worth the money. After that I am going to learn
              Javascript from the previous web bootcamps. For further I will go
              through <strong>Hitesh Choudhary</strong> free course and a paid
              course of the same instructor of HTML and CSS it is also best
              seller. But i need to compare that course because his alternative
              are pretty good as well. With that I also going to purchase
              typography course by <strong>Rajeev Mehta</strong>, Which is a
              excellent course for designing the front end. After that deeper
              dive into backend which i will tell later.
